## 📥 Step 1: Install Git

Git is required to download the repository.

1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/windows)
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing: `git --version`

## 🐧 Step 2: Update WSL and Install Ubuntu

Update Windows Subsystem for Linux and install Ubuntu for optimal Docker performance.

1. **Open PowerShell or Terminal as Administrator**
2. **Update WSL**: `wsl --update`
3. **Set WSL 2 as default**: `wsl --set-default-version 2`
4. **Check if you already have Ubuntu installed**: `wsl -l -v`
   - If Ubuntu is listed, skip to step 5
   - If not, install Ubuntu: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
5. **Launch Ubuntu** from the Start menu and complete the initial setup if this is your first time (create username/password)

## 🐳 Step 3: Install Docker Desktop with WSL

Docker Desktop will run your rebalancing tool in containers.

1. **Download Docker Desktop** from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. **During installation**, ensure **"Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V"** is checked
3. **After installation**, open Docker Desktop
4. **Configure WSL Integration**:
   - Go to Settings → General → Verify **"Use the WSL 2 based engine"** is enabled
   - Go to Settings → Resources → WSL Integration → Enable integration with your Ubuntu distribution
5. **Restart Docker Desktop** if needed

## 📁 Step 4: Clone the Repository

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**
2. **Create your preferred directory** e.g. `mkdir %USERPROFILE%\docker\zehnlabs`
3. **Navigate to zehnlabs directory** e.g. `cd %USERPROFILE%\docker\zehnlabs`
4. **Clone the repository**:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer.git
   cd ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer
   ```

## ⚙️ Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example environment file**:
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file**:
   ```cmd
   notepad .env
   ```
   💡 *(You can use any text editor of your choice)*

3. Update the following values with your actual credentials:
   ```env
   # Interactive Brokers Account Configuration
   IB_USERNAME=your_ib_username
   IB_PASSWORD=your_ib_password

   # Trading Configuration
   TRADING_MODE=paper  # Start with 'paper' for testing, change to 'live' when ready; make sure you have an IBKR paper account
   TIME_IN_FORCE=GTC   # GTC (Good Till Cancelled) or DAY
   EXTENDED_HOURS_ENABLED=true

   # API Keys
   ALLOCATIONS_API_KEY=your_allocations_api_key
   REBALANCE_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_API_KEY=your_realtime_api_key

   # Optional. VNC Configuration (for accessing IB Gateway GUI if needed)
   VNC_PASSWORD=choose_a_secure_password

   # Application Configuration
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Use DEBUG for troubleshooting, INFO for normal operation

   # Optional. Testing account if you want to test using REST API
   TEST_ACCOUNT_ID=your_ibkr_account_id
   ```

## 🏦 Step 6: Configure Trading Accounts

1. **Copy the example accounts file**:
   ```cmd
   copy accounts.example.yaml accounts.yaml
   ```

2. **Edit the accounts configuration**:
   ```cmd
   notepad accounts.yaml
   ```
   💡 *(You can use any text editor of your choice)*

3. **Configure your trading accounts**. 

   ⚠️ **If you only want to trade one account, remove the second account section entirely.**

   **📊 Example for a single account:**
   ```yaml
   # Account 1
   ############
   - account_id: "U123456"  # Your IBKR account ID
     notification:
       # Zehnlabs strategy name: all lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens
       # You must be subscribed to this strategy
       channel: "etf-blend-200-35"
     rebalancing:
       # Cash reserve: 0% to 10% (defaults to 1% if outside range)
       cash_reserve_percentage: 2.0
   ```

   **🏢 Example for multiple accounts:**
   ```yaml
   # Account 1
   ############
   - account_id: "U123456"
     notification:
       channel: "etf-blend-200-35"
     rebalancing:
       cash_reserve_percentage: 2.0

   # Account 2
   ############
   - account_id: "U654321"
     notification:
       channel: "etf-blend-301-20"
     rebalancing:
       cash_reserve_percentage: 2.5
   ```

## 🚀 Step 7: Start the Application

1. **Ensure Docker Desktop is running**
2. **In your Command Prompt or PowerShell**, from the project directory, run:
   ```cmd 
   docker compose up
   ```

This command will:
- 📥 Download required Docker images (first run takes a few minutes)
- 🔨 Build the application containers
- ⚡ Start all services

## 📋 Step 8: View Logs and Verify Successful Start

1. **Open Docker Desktop**
2. **Go to the "Containers" tab**
3. **Find and click on your project container**
4. **Click on "Logs"** to view the application logs

**✅ Look for these success indicators:**
- No error messages in the logs
- Services start without crashing

**❌ If you see errors:**
- Check your `.env` file credentials
- Check your account ID
- Verify your ZehnLabs subscription is active
- Ensure Interactive Brokers account is properly set up

## 🩺 Step 9: Verify System Health

After starting the system, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check all services are running
docker compose ps

# System health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Queue status
curl http://localhost:8000/queue/status
```

**🌐 Access points:**
- **🏥 Health Status**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **📊 Queue Status**: `http://localhost:8000/queue/status`
- **🖥️ IBKR Gateway GUI**: `http://localhost:6080` (for troubleshooting)

# 🌐 Alternative Setups

While this guide focuses on Windows + WSL + Docker Desktop, the tool works on other platforms:

- **macOS**: Install Docker Desktop for Mac, use Terminal instead of WSL
- **Linux**: Install Docker and Docker Compose, use native terminal
- **Cloud hosting**: Deploy on Digital Ocean droplets, AWS EC2, etc. - see [Remote Monitoring Guide](monitoring.md)
- **Other Windows setups**: Can run without WSL using Command Prompt/PowerShell

The Docker-based approach ensures consistent behavior across all platforms.
