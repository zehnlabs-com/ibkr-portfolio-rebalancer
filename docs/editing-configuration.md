```

## üìä Account Configuration (accounts.yaml)

The `accounts.yaml` file defines which accounts to manage and their settings.

### Basic Structure

```yaml
accounts:
  # First account
  - account_id: "U123456"          # Your IBKR account ID
    type: paper                    # "paper" or "live"
    notification:
      channel: "etf-blend-200-35"  # Your strategy name
    rebalancing:
      cash_reserve_percent: 1.0    # Cash buffer (0-100%)

  # Second account
  - account_id: "U654321"
    type: paper
    notification:
      channel: "etf-blend-301-20"
    rebalancing:
      cash_reserve_percent: 1.0
```

### Field Descriptions

#### account_id
- Your IBKR account number
- Live accounts start with "U" (e.g., U123456)
- Paper accounts start with "DU" (e.g., DU123456)

#### type
- Must match your TRADING_MODE in .env
- `paper`: For paper trading accounts
- `live`: For real money accounts

#### notification.channel
- Your Zehnlabs strategy name
- Must be lowercase with hyphens (no spaces)
- Must match your active subscription
- Examples: `etf-blend-100-20`, `equity-growth-50-15`

#### rebalancing.cash_reserve_percent
- Percentage of equity to keep as cash buffer
- Helps handle price fluctuations during rebalancing
- Range: 0.0 to 100.0
- Recommended: 1.0 to 2.0

### IRA Account ETF Replacements

Some ETFs cannot be traded in IRA accounts due to regulations. The system automatically replaces them:

```yaml
accounts:
  - account_id: "U789012"
    type: live
    replacement_set: ira    # Enable IRA replacements
    notification:
      channel: "etf-blend-200-35"
    rebalancing:
      cash_reserve_percent: 1.0

# Replacement rules (already configured)
replacement_sets:
  ira:
    - source: UVXY
      target: VXX
      scale: 1.5    # 1 UVXY = 1.5 VXX equivalent
```
