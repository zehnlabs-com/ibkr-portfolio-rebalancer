When the DigitalOcean page opens:
1. **Enter a root password** - Save this password securely!
2. **Keep all other defaults** (region, size, etc.)
3. **Click "Create Droplet"**

Wait 1-2 minutes for your droplet to fully start.

### Step 2: Install Tabby Terminal and Connect to Your Droplet

#### Install Tabby Terminal
You can use another SSH client of your choice, if you so prefer. 

1. **Download Tabby** from [https://tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh)
   - Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Choose the installer for your operating system

2. **Install and launch Tabby**

#### Set Up SSH Connection with Port Forwarding

1. **Open Tabby** and click the **Settings** button (gear icon)

2. **Navigate to** "Profiles & connections" ‚Üí "New profile" and select "SSH"

3. **Configure the SSH profile:**
   - **Name:** `IBKR Portfolio Rebalancer`
   - **Host:** `YOUR_DROPLET_IP` (replace with your droplet's IP)
   - **Password:** `YOUR_DROPLET_PASSWORD` (replace with your droplet's password)

4. **Save the profile** and connect to your droplet

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Execute the automated setup script in your SSH terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This script will:
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up Docker containers
- Provide you with next steps

### Step 4: Configure Port Forwarding

**üìñ Follow the port forwarding setup guide**: [Port Forwarding Setup](port-forwarding-setup.md)

You'll need to configure port forwarding in your SSH profile to access the web services locally.

### Step 5: Configure Your Installation

The setup script will:
- Clone the repository
- Set up configuration files
- Show you documentation links
- **Wait for you to edit the configuration files**

When the script pauses:

1. **Follow the complete configuration guide**: [Editing Configuration](https://github.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer/blob/main/docs/editing-configuration.md)

2. **Return to your setup script** and press ENTER to continue

3. The script will then:
   - Start all Docker containers
   - Verify services are running
   - Provide access URLs

### Step 6: Access Your Services

Once setup completes, you can access:

- **üìä Container management / Log Viewer**: http://localhost:8080
  - Real-time logs from all services
  - Start/stop containers
  - Search and filter logs

- **üîß Management API**: http://localhost:8000

üí° **Remember:** Your Tabby SSH connection with port forwarding must remain open to access these services.
