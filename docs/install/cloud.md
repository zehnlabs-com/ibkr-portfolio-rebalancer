# üöÄ Installation - Cloud Deployment (DigitalOcean)

Deploy your IBKR Portfolio Rebalancer with one click on DigitalOcean!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- ‚úÖ **DigitalOcean account** - [Sign up here](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- üí≥ **Payment method added** to your DigitalOcean account

## Quick Deploy

### Step 1: Create Your Droplet

Click the button below to deploy a pre-configured droplet:

[![Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new?appId=195049442&size=s-2vcpu-2gb&region=nyc3&image=docker-20-04&type=applications)

When the DigitalOcean page opens:
1. **Enter a root password** - Save this password securely!
2. **Keep all other defaults** (region, size, etc.)
3. **Click "Create Droplet"**

Wait a few minutes for your droplet to fully start.

### Step 2: Secure Your Droplet with a Firewall

Before proceeding, let's secure your droplet by creating a firewall:

1. **Go to your Droplet page** in DigitalOcean
2. **Click "Networking"** in the left sidebar menu
3. **Click "Firewalls"** section
4. **Click "Create Firewall"** button
5. **Configure your firewall:**
   - **Name:** Enter a name for your firewall (e.g., "ibkr-rebalancer-firewall")
   - **Inbound Rules:** Keep the default rules (SSH on port 22 is already configured)
   - **Apply to Droplets:** Type and select your droplet's name in this field
6. **Click "Create Firewall"** button at the bottom

Your droplet is now protected by a firewall that only allows SSH connections.

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Go to the droplet page and click on `Connect` to open your droplet's SSH terminal. Execute the automated setup script in the terminal:

NOTE: When pasting into SSH terminal, use `CTRL+Shift+V` or right click then select `Paste as plain text`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer/main/setup.sh | sudo bash -s -- --cloud
```

This script will:
- Clone the repository
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up Docker containers
- Optionally setup Tailscale for secure remote access
- Provide you with next steps

### Step 4: Configure Your Installation

When the script pauses:

1. **Follow the complete configuration guide**: [Editing Configuration](https://github.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer/blob/main/docs/editing-configuration.md)

2. **Return to your setup script** and press ENTER to continue

3. The script will then:
   - Start all Docker containers
   - Verify services are running
   - Provide access URLs

### Step 5: Access Your Services

Once setup completes, you can access:

- **üìä Container management / Log Viewer**: http://<YOUR HOST NAME>:8080
  - Real-time logs from all services
  - Start/stop containers
  - Search and filter logs

- **üîß Management API**: http://<YOUR HOST NAME>:8000
  - Health checks
  - Queue status
  - System monitoring

## Post-Installation

### Notifications

- Follow the guide: [User Notifications Setup](https://github.com/zehnlabs-com/ibkr-portfolio-rebalancer/blob/main/docs/user-notifications.md)

## Troubleshooting
